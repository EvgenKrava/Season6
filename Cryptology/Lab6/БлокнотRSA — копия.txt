Dear diary,
i woke up early today because my best friend invited me to a party in the evening, And i have some preparings to do. It is not a party in common sense, because it will be in local volunteering community, which deals with homeless people and bottle gathering. I know, this organization is weird, but she said, that there will be free drinks and no one will ask about your age! And, we will be together, so what can happen to me?
